   <% if !@pets.empty? %><!---Would like an additional condition to say here if count of pets reviewed is > 0 then make adopts button active-->
      <!---I want this Adopt button to only appear once and be used by a selected radio button --->
      <!---Would like to pass the data into this button when the choice of a pet is selected based on a radio button.---->

<!--- old code:pet_id =>pet.id --->

<!---Below code for trying to build a counter of pet.reviewed pets without respect to any id but with the respect to how many of these objects are in the table pets, don't know the syntax for build a counter object in ruby on rails to be used later for secondary condition for adopts. Thinking it might need to be global or potentially local or some way to count in the controller itself and then feedback the information into the view itself so that when modulus of x is used on it, the data is then diveded between inner and outer divs--->
